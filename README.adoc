== Agenda
I need to create an interactive page which has some clickable products.
Products, if clicked, will be added to cart which is situated at the right
side of the page.

== Functionality Implemented
. Search / Filter Works.
. Items can be added to cart by clicking.
. Price is calculated in the widget bottom-right corner.
. Items can be removed from cart with the delete button.
  * Item count is shown at the right top of the image.
  * If the item is added more than once, clicking on delete button will reduce the item count.
